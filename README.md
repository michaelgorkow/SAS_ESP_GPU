# SAS Event Stream Processing Docker Container with GPU acceleration

This repository provides build instructions to create your own SAS Event Stream Processing Docker Container with GPU acceleration.

### Overview
SAS Event Stream Processing already offers the possibility to be installed as a Docker container. So, why does this repository exist?
Looking at the official [documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=dplyesp0phy0lax&docsetTarget=p1rcii2jo7dt9yn1qr1upedc0y3w.htm&docsetVersion=6.2&locale=en) you will notice that the Docker image does not support GPU acceleration.

However GPU acceleration is needed or at least recommended if you want to work with deep learning.
For this reason I decided to share my work of creating GPU accelerated for SAS Event Stream Processing.

Please note:
This repository is privately owned by me. Don't expect any official support for the work provided here.

### Requirements
* Valid SAS Event Stream Processing license file (tested with SAS Viya 3.5)
* System with NVIDIA GPU (tested with RTX2070, RTX3000 and V100)
* Linux OS (tested with Ubuntu 18.04 and Centos 7)
* NVIDIA Driver (tested with version 430/450)
* [NVIDIA Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

### Container Setup
1. Pull this repository<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/Mentos05/SAS_ESP_GPU.git
```
2. Copy your license file into the repository folder (usually named: SAS_Viya_deployment_data.zip)
2. Go into the repository folder and run docker build command<br>
```
cd SAS_ESP_GPU
docker build .  -t esp:gpu
```

### Run Container
Simply use docker run and attach your gpus:
```
docker run -it --net=host --gpus all esp:gpu
```
In many cases you want to extend your run call with additional variables to configure the container.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| ESP_PORT | ESP -port option | 9900 |
| ESP_PUBSUB_PORT | ESP -pubsub option | 31416 |
| ESP_LOGLEVEL | ESP -loglevel option | error |
| ESP_MAS_THREADS | MAS Threads | 1 |
| MAS_PYLOG_LEVEL | MAS logging level | ERROR |
| MAS_PYLOG_FILE | MAS logfile location | /opt/maspylog.txt |
| JUPYTERLAB_PORT | JupyterLab port | 8080 |
| JUPYTERLAB_NBDIR | JupyterLab notebook directory | /data/notebooks/ |

Example: `docker run -it --net=host -e ESP_PORT 12345 --gpus all esp:gpu` will run the ESP server on port 12345.

You should see something like this:<br>

### Access Jupyter Lab
Open one of the following URLs in your browser:
* JupyterLab: http://localhost:8080

Use the following credentials:<br>
Username = sas<br>
Password = saspw

### Whats next?
Connect to your container, e.g. via [SAS ESPPy](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-esppy).<br>
Your container is running on port 9900 by default.
```
import esppy
esp = esppy.ESP(hostname='http://localhost:9900')
```

### Jupyter Lab (Python Environment)
Some of the Python packages installed are:<br>

| Package | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| SAS SWAT | [SAS SWAT](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-swat) |
| SAS DLPy | [SAS DLPy](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-dlpy) | 
| SAS ESPPy | [SAS ESPPy](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-esppy) |
| OpenCV | [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) |
| OpenPose | [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) |

For a full list, please look at the python_sas.yml file in /jupyterlab_environments folder.
When building your own container, you can add your own environment.yml files into /jupyterlab_environments folder to have customized Python environments.

### Share ressources with your container
If you want to share ressources with your container, e.g. a webcam, you can do so by adapting your docker run command.<br>
To share devices, e.g. your webcam, use:
```
docker run --device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 --net=host esp:gpu
```
To share a folder, e.g. with additional data like models, projects, etc. use:
```
docker run -v folder-on-host:folder-on-container --net=host esp:gpu
```

Example: For my needs I usually start my container with the following command to share my local notebooks, my webcam, host networking interface and to allow GUI applications (e.g. Opencv).<br>
```
docker run -it --privileged=true --net=host --ipc=host \
           -v /home/michael/Development/github.com/:/data/notebooks \
           --device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 \
           --gpus all -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
           -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
           esp:gpu
```

### Run GUI applications inside your Docker container
I am using OpenCV very often to display the scored images from ESP. To allow OpenCV to access your hosts display you'll have to allow access to your X server.
To do this simply type `xhost +` on your host system.
Additionally you'll have to provide some information to your container by adding the following statements to your run-command:<br>
```
-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY
-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix
```

### Verify/Monitor GPU Usage
While you should notice a significant performance improvement while training/scoring your deep learning models you can also monitor GPU usage by using:
```
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```
nvidia-smi should show a cas-process.
![nvidia-smi monitoring](img/nvidia-smi.png "nvidia-smi monitoring")<br>
Make sure you run this command on your host, not inside the container.
